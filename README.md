## Introduction

A field-programmable gate array, or "FPGA" for short is an integrated circuit designed to be re-programmable using a hardware description language such as VHDL and Verilog to customize a certain digital logic. An FPGA is an extremely flexible and sophisticated device that can be programmed to function as other specific devices hence reducing the amount of hardware needed as well as the cost and power consumption.
